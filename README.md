## 🛠️ Developer Guide (Source Code)

For developers who want to modify the code or build the executable themselves.

### 1. Clone & Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies.

cd my-media-server

# 1. Install Backend Dependencies

```

### 2. Build the Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm run build
cd ..
```

### 3. Run in Development

```bash
npm start
```

### 4. Build the Executable (pkg)

## ⚙️ Configuration & Security

- **Config Storage:** All sensitive data is stored in `~/.myflix/config.json` (Hidden User Directory), keeping your media folders clean.
